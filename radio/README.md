# Adding AUX in to the Delco 70HFP1 Radio in a 1977 Corvette

Adding AUX in to this radio is simple, but I could not find any precise guide.

This modification replaces the AM radio with the AUX in. You could also add a switch, or a switching jack, to retain AM radio. Who would want that. Are you racist?

The pictures were taken after, so the aux in is already in place.

## Open the radio

There are screws that can be removed with a quarter inch socket, two on the back, one on each side.

## Attach AUX In

This radio is mono, so combine the Left and Right channels with two 50 ohm resistors. Someone on the internet said 33-100 ohm is fine, so I used what I had.

Cut the "AM AUD" trace, and attach the aux in to the AM/FM selector switch.

Attach the gound to any nearby ground.

Use hot snot or something for strain releif. Don't overthink it.

## Notes

My radio had a label that said NOT to operate it without appropriate speakers attached, so if you test it out of the car, check that.

The AM / FM selector comes off with the front panel, so just unscrew 4x screws on the front to remove it and the panel for cleaning.
